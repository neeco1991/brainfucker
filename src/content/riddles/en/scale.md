hints: ['Initially, the marbles are divided into 3 groups of 4 marbles each.']
solution: "The marbles are divided into 3 groups of 4. Marbles 1, 2, 3, and 4 are part of the first group, marbles 5, 6, 7, and 8 are part of the second group, and marbles 9, 10, 11, and 12 are in the third group. The first two groups of marbles are weighed on separate plates. Three things can happen: A) The two groups weigh the same, B) Marbles 1, 2, 3, and 4 are lower, and C) Marbles 5, 6, 7, and 8 are lower. If A happens, marbles 1 and 9 are placed on one plate and marbles 10 and 11 on another. Here, three things can occur: AA) If they weigh the same, then marble 12 is the different one. A third weighing with any other marble will determine if it's heavier or lighter. AB) If the plate with marbles 1 and 9 goes down, then either 9 is heavier or one of 10 or 11 is lighter. With the third weighing, 10 and 11 are compared. If the plates are balanced, then marble 9 is the lighter one. Otherwise, the heavier marble is on the lowered plate. AC) If the plate with marbles 10 and 11 goes down, the same technique as AB (reversed) is used to identify the different marble. If B happens, then marbles 1, 5, and 9 are placed on one plate and marbles 2, 3, and 8 on another. Three possibilities exist: BA) The plates are balanced, BB) The first plate is lower, and BC) The second plate is lower. For BA, the different marble could be 4 (heavier) or either 6 or 7 (lighter). With the third weighing, 6 and 7 are compared. If different, the lighter one stays up. If the same, 4 is the heavier. For BB, 1 is heavier or 8 is lighter. With the third weighing, comparing 1 with any other marble will show if 1 is heavier or 8 is lighter. For BC, the same technique as BB (reversed) applies. If C occurs, the same technique as B (reversed) is used."

## Prologue

In a parallel world, there lies an enchanted castle, guardian of secrets and mysteries, named "The Castle of Balances". At the heart of this castle is a magical scale, capable of weighing anything with absolute precision, and 12 magical marbles. These marbles appear identical in every way, but one of them weighs differently than the others, being either lighter or heavier. It is said that anyone who can discover which marble weighs differently will unlock the powers of the scale and gain knowledge of parallel worlds.

## Description

Adventurers must use the magical scale to determine which of the 12 marbles weighs differently, and if it is lighter or heavier than the others. They only have 3 weighings to solve the riddle.

## The Question

How can the adventurers use the 3 available weighings to definitely determine which marble weighs differently and if it is lighter or heavier than the others?

## FAQ

- The marbles all look identical, and there are no ways to distinguish the different marble except by using the scale.
- The adventurers cannot alter or damage the marbles or the scale in any way.
- The weighings must be done one at a time.
- Yes, there are only 3 weighings.
