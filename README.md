# Contribute

Brainfucker is a free and open-source project. You can contribute by adding new riddles, improving the existing ones, or translating them into other languages. The only rule is that the riddles must be extremely logical and without tricks.

If you're familiar with **git** and the **markdown** format, you can open a pull request on this repository, adding a riddle is as easy as creating a **.md** file.

Otherwise, you can send an email to brainfkr23@gmail.com.
