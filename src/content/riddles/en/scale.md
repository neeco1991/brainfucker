hints: ['First, divide the marbles into 3 groups of 4 marbles each.']
solution: "Divide the marbles into 3 groups of 4. Marbles 1, 2, 3, and 4 make up the first group; marbles 5, 6, 7, and 8 the second; and marbles 9, 10, 11, and 12 the third. Weigh the marbles of the first two groups on separate scales. Three outcomes can happen: A) Both groups weigh the same, B) Marbles 1, 2, 3, and 4 are heavier, and C) Marbles 5, 6, 7, and 8 are heavier. If A occurs, place marbles 1 and 9 on one side and marbles 10 and 11 on the other. Again, three things can happen: AA) The groups weigh the same, in which case marble 12 is the odd one out. A third weighing will determine if it's heavier or lighter. AB) If the side with marbles 1 and 9 is heavier, then either 9 is heavier, or one of 10 or 11 is lighter. The third weighing of 10 against 11 will determine which. AC) If the side with marbles 10 and 11 is heavier, the same (reversed) technique from AB can be used. If B occurs, place marbles 1, 5, and 9 on one side and 2, 3, and 8 on the other. Three outcomes can occur: BA) The sides are balanced, BB) The side with marbles 1, 5, and 9 is heavier, or BC) The side with marbles 2, 3, and 8 is heavier. If BA, then either marble 4 is heavier, or one of 6 or 7 is lighter. A third weighing of 6 against 7 will determine which. If BB, then either marble 1 is heavier or 8 is lighter. A third weighing of 1 against any other marble will determine which. If BC, the same (reversed) technique from BB can be used. If C occurs, the same (reversed) technique from B can be used."

## Prologue

At the gates of the underworld, on the shores of the River Acheron, the three infernal judges Minos, Aeacus, and Rhadamanthus await the souls destined for eternal damnation to submit them to the riddle of the scales. Those who act with wisdom and cunning will be allowed to enter the Elysian Fields; for all other souls, the verdict will be dire and inescapable.

## Description

The Scales of Hekate, the great chthonic goddess invoked by necromancers, can weigh anything with absolute precision. Souls are given twelve marbles representing the gods of Olympus: Zeus, Hera, Hephaestus, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Aphrodite, Hestia, Hermes, Demeter, and Poseidon. These marbles seem identical, but one of them has a different weight, being either lighter or heavier. The souls have only three weighings to determine which marble is different and whether it's heavier or lighter.

## The Question

How can the souls use the three available weighings to determine with certainty which marble has a different weight and whether it is lighter or heavier than the others?

## FAQ

- The marbles all look identical, and there are no ways to distinguish the different marble except by using the scales.
- The adventurers cannot tamper with or damage the marbles or the scales in any way.
- The weighings must be performed one at a time.
- Yes, there are only 3 weighings.
