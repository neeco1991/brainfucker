    'Only one can guess.',
    'Before the explorer guesses, there is a time when no one says anything.',
    'The explorer who guesses is the second from the left.',
  ]
solution: 'The two adventurers closest to the wall have no information, so they cannot guess. The first from the left sees two hats of opposite colors and therefore has a 50% chance of having a white hat and a 50% chance of having a black hat. The second from the left, however, reasons this way: "If the hat on me and the one in front of me were the same color, then the person behind me would guess because they would be certain about the color of their hat. Since the person behind me isn''t guessing, it means my hat is the opposite color of the one in front of me."'

## Prologue

Hidden in the dense and mysterious Deccan jungle, beyond inaccessible mountains, stands an ancient Hindu temple. At the center of the temple is the Enigma Chamber, where the Priestess of Shiva, guardian of the temple, poses riddles to adventurers, to test their courage and intellect and to protect the sacred ground from the footprints of the wicked.

## Description

Four brave explorers are welcomed by the Priestess and placed in the Chamber as shown in the figure: three of them are in a single line on one side of a majestic golden wall, while the fourth stands alone on the other side of the wall. The wall is so high that it prevents anyone from seeing above or around it. Each explorer has a hat placed on their head by the Priestess. Every adventurer faces the wall and can only see the hats of all other explorers positioned between themselves and the wall. The explorers are informed that there are exactly 2 white hats and 2 black hats.

## The Question

The group of adventurers is asked the following question by the Priestess: "What color is your hat?". If the answer is wrong, a barrage of arrows would end their lives instantly.

## FAQ

- The explorers cannot communicate with each other in any way, either verbally or non-verbally.
- The only information available to them is the color of the hat of the explorers positioned in front of them and before the wall.
- No tricks can be used to obtain additional information.
