solution: "The adventurers count 10 coins from one side of the table and form a group with them (Group X). The rest of the coins form the other group (Group Y). At this point, they flip all 10 coins of Group X. They don't need to know which face is up, they just flip them. In this way, the two groups will have the same number of coins with face B up."

## Prologue

In an underground kingdom, hidden in the folds of time, a mysterious entity known as the Guardian of Fate possesses a treasure made up of 500 magical coins. These coins, each with two differently colored faces, are the source of the Guardian's power and the secret to his immortality. Legend has it that anyone able to unravel the mystery of the coins can gain knowledge and powers beyond imagination.

## Description

The 500 coins are laid out on a large ancient table. Out of these, 490 have face A facing upwards, while 10 have face B facing upwards. The Guardian of Fate challenges the adventurers to solve the coin riddle. While blindfolded, the adventurers must divide the coins into two groups such that in each group there is the same number of coins with face B facing upwards.

## The Question

How can the adventurers, while being blindfolded, divide the 500 coins into two groups such that in each group there is the same number of coins with face B facing up?

## FAQ

- The adventurers cannot in any way see the coins or perceive the colors of the faces while blindfolded.
- Adventurers can touch and move the coins, but they cannot distinguish the faces of the coins by touch.
- There are no tricks or methods to see through the blindfold or to mark the coins in any way.
