    "Before the explorer guesses, there's a period of time when no one says anything.",
    'The explorer who guesses is the second from the left.',
  ]
solution: "The two adventurers closest to the wall have no information, so they can't guess. The first one from the left sees two hats of different colors, so he has a 50% chance of having a white hat and a 50% chance of having a black one. The second from the left, however, reasons as follows: 'If both I and the explorer in front of me had hats of the same color, then the explorer behind me would guess, because he would be certain of the color of his hat. Since he isn't guessing, it means that my hat is of a different color from that of the explorer in front of me.'"

## Prologue

In a dense and mysterious jungle, beyond impassable mountains, stands an ancient hidden temple. This temple is inhabited by the Guardian of Riddles, an immortal entity tasked with asking questions to test the wit and bravery of adventurers. At the center of the temple lies the "Riddle Chamber".

## Description

Four brave explorers are led by the Guardian into the Chamber. They are positioned as shown in a figure: three of them are in a line on one side of a majestic golden wall, while the fourth is on the other side of the wall. The wall is so tall that no one can see over or around it. All the adventurers are facing the wall and can only see the hats of all the other explorers placed between him and the wall.

Each of the explorers has a hat placed on their head by the Guardian of Riddles. The explorers are informed that there are exactly 2 white hats and 2 black hats.

## The Question

The group of adventurers is asked the following question by the Guardian of Riddles: "What color is your hat?" The Guardian says that only one of them has the information needed to solve the riddle, and once solved, they would be granted freedom and the hidden treasure within the chamber.

## FAQ

- The explorers cannot communicate with each other in any way, either verbally or non-verbally.
- The only information available to them is the color of the hat of the explorers in front of them before the wall.
- It's not possible to use any trick to get further information.
