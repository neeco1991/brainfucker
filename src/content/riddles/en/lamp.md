hints: ["The light bulbs don't only emit energy in the form of light"]
solution: "The stranger turns on the first switch and waits for several minutes. After waiting, he turns off the first switch, turns on the second, and enters the bulb room. The bulb that is lit corresponds to the second switch, as it's the only one currently on. The bulb that is off but warm to touch corresponds to the first switch, since it was on long enough to heat the bulb but is now off. The bulb that is off and cold corresponds to the third switch, as it was never turned on. By doing this, the stranger can confidently match each switch to its corresponding bulb and save his life."

## Prologue

Nevada, 1969. A shady individual has just forcefully loaded a stranger onto his Ford Falcon to take him to his hideout and subject him to a bizarre riddle as a gamble for his life. The man will pose a question to the abducted stranger, and only if the stranger answers correctly will he have the chance to save himself.

## Description

The stranger faces two closed rooms. In one, there are three switches; in the other, there are three light bulbs. Each switch lights up only one light bulb. The kidnapper's question is: which switch lights up which light bulb?

## The Question

The stranger can manipulate the switches as much as he wants, but he can enter the bulb room only once. After entering that room, he can no longer go back to the switch room.

## FAQ

- The stranger can turn the switches on and off as many times as he wishes before entering the bulb room.
- Once he enters the bulb room, he cannot return to the switch room.
- The light bulbs and switches have no distinguishing marks.
