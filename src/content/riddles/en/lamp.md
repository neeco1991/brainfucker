hints: ["Bulbs don't emit energy only in the form of light"]
solution: "The adventurer turns on the first switch and waits for several minutes. After waiting, he turns off the first switch, turns on the second one, and enters the bulb room. The bulb that is on corresponds to the second switch, since it's the only one that's currently on. The bulb that is off but warm to the touch corresponds to the first switch, as it has been on long enough to heat up the bulb but is now off. The bulb that is off and cold corresponds to the third switch since it has never been turned on. In this way, the adventurer can confidently associate each switch to its corresponding bulb."

## Prologue

In a distant and mysterious kingdom, there exist two secret rooms, hidden from the eyes of commoners. One room contains three switches and the other three bulbs. An adventurer, in search of hidden treasures, is challenged to solve a riddle to access the secrets of the rooms. He can only enter the bulb room once and has to figure out which switch corresponds to which bulb.

## Description

The adventurer stands before two closed rooms. In one, there are three switches, and in the other, there are three bulbs. Each switch lights up one and only one bulb. The adventurer can manipulate the switches as much as he wants, but can only enter the bulb room once. After entering that room, he cannot return to the switch room.

## The Question

How can the adventurer confidently determine which switch lights up which bulb, entering the bulb room only once?

## FAQ

- The adventurer can turn the switches on and off as many times as he wants before entering the bulb room.
- Once he enters the bulb room, the adventurer cannot return to the switch room.
- The bulbs and switches have no distinguishing marks.
